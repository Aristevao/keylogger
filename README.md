# Keylogger using Python and Pynput

This repository contains a simple keylogger implementation using the `pynput` library in Python. The keylogger listens for key presses and logs them into a text file (`keyfile.txt`), capturing both normal and special keys.

## Features
- Logs key presses to a file (`keyfile.txt`).
- Handles both character and special keys (e.g., spacebar, enter).
- Written in Python using the `pynput` library for keyboard event listening.

## How to Use

1. **Install the required library:**

   First, install the `pynput` library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput

## Disclaimer
This is a basic keylogger intended for educational purposes. Be cautious and ensure that you have explicit permission before monitoring any keyboard input. Unauthorized use of keyloggers may be illegal in many jurisdictions.
